        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 loaf of French or Italian bread</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
                <li>Slice the bread: Cut the loaf of bread in half lengthwise.</li>
                <li>Make the garlic butter: In a medium bowl, mix together the softened butter, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt (if using), and black pepper until well combined.</li>
                <li>Spread the garlic butter: Evenly spread the garlic butter mixture over the cut sides of the bread.</li>
                <li>Add Parmesan cheese: If desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the buttered bread.</li>
                <li>Bake the bread: Place the bread halves on a baking sheet, cut side up, and bake in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the bread is golden and the butter is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Optional broil: For extra crispy garlic bread, you can broil the bread for an additional 1-2 minutes, keeping a close eye to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>Serve: Remove the bread from the oven, let it cool slightly, then slice and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
